# Group Management 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../assets/stylesheets/images.css">


## Overview

HPC groups allow faculty members to manage file permissions, job allocations, and group members. When a PI creates a new HPC account, a group is created with an allocation of space and time. Additional storage is available for free upon request, called [xdisk](../../storage_and_transfers/storage/hpc_storage/)

There are two types of Groups: 

* **Research Groups**

    Research groups include any faculty, postdocs, graduate students, DCCs, staff, or student workers actively affiliated with your group's research. 

* **Class Groups**

    These are for educational purposes only and will include students enrolled in a semester-long course.

## Research Groups

If you are a faculty member who has [registered for an HPC account](../account_creation/), a research group named after your Arizona NetID has been automatically created for you. This group has [an allocation of CPU hours](../../resources/allocations/) associated with it as well as [communal storage for your data](../../storage_and_transfers/storage/hpc_storage/).

**Membership and Allocation**

Members of research groups have full access to the PI's allocation. PIs are able to create multiple research groups that pull from the same allocation. Users are able to be members of multiple research groups. Creating multiple research groups does not change the total CPU-time allocation.

**Permissions**

Research groups can also be used to manage access permissions to files and folders on HPC. The PI can use the ```chgrp``` command to change which group has access rights corresponding to the 'group' setting on a particular item. See our [Linux File Permissions](/support_and_training/cheat_sheet/#linux-file-permissions) cheat sheet for more information.


### Adding Members

To add members to your research group, go to [https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/](https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/) and click the **Groups** tab at the top of the screen. 

<img class="ood-screenshots" src="images/group_add.png" title="Manage group members">

Click your group's dropdown tab and navigate to where it says **Add a new group member**. In the field below, enter the new group member's NetID and click ":material-account-plus: ADD MEMBER". 

<img class="ood-screenshots" src="images/add_member.png" title="Add NetID">

To add members in bulk, you may also select **Upload Member List** and upload a CSV file of Arizona NetIDs.

The process of adding new members may take a few seconds to complete. Once the changes have taken place, you will see the user's NetID in your group.



### Creating a New Group

A new group can be created at any time through the user portal. New groups will share their time and storage allocations with your primary group. Alternate research groups can be a good solution for managing file permissions. For example, if a particular directory and its contents needs restricted access, you could do this by creating a new research group, adding the group members who need access to those files, and then changing the group ownership of the files/directories.

To create a new group, log into the user portal, navigate to the **Groups** tab and select the **Add New Group** dropdown menu. In the **Group Name** field, enter the name of the group you'd like to create. Under **Group Type**, select **researchGroup**, then select the :material-account-multiple-plus: to confirm.

<img src="images/create-research-group.png" class="ood-screenshots" title="Add new research group">

Once your group has been created, you will see it when running ```va``` (short for View Allocation) in the same block as your primary group:

```bash
(puma) [faculty-netid@junonia ~]$ va
PI: parent_1206 Total time: 7000:00:00
    Group: faculty-netid Time used: 0:00:00 Time encumbered: 0:00:00
    Group: your-new-group Time used: 0:00:00 Time encumbered: 0:00:00
    Total used: 0:00:00
    Total encumbered: 0:00:00
    Total remaining: 7000:00:00
```

## Class Groups

!!! tip 
    If you are interested in having an HPC staff member come to your class to do an Intro to HPC presentation, reach out to our consultants.
    
If you are a faculty member and are teaching a course that makes use of HPC resources, you can create a class group that will grant your students system access. Class groups are designed to be created and used for one semester only.

### Class Group Restrictions

Due to Arizona sales tax restrictions {==class groups are restricted to the Ocelote cluster and cannot use Puma or El Gato==}. To submit standard jobs on Ocelote, students will use the class group's name for the `--account` Slurm directive. For example:

```bash
#SBATCH --account=hpc101
#SBATCH --partition=standard
```
Class group members may also use the Windfall partition on Ocelote. 

### Creating a Class Group

Log into your [user portal](https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/), navigate to the **Groups** tab, and select the **Add New Group** dropdown option at the top of the page.There will be an option to specify your **Group Type**. Choose **classGroup** from the dropdown menu. Then under **Group Name** enter the name of your group. Finally, click :material-account-multiple-plus: to complete the process. 

<img src="images/create-class-group.png" class="ood-screenshots" title="Class group interface">


Once this process is complete, you can find your group's dropdown under the **Groups** tab. There you can add students either individually or in batch by uploading a CSV file with your student's NetIDs. You may also remove students from the group by clicking the "REMOVE :material-account-minus:" button. You can also delete the group itself by selecting ":material-account-multiple-minus: REMOVE GROUP".

### File Permissions and Storage
Students in your class group will only be able to access files and directories owned by the class group. This means they will not be able to access files and directories owned by your standard research group. 

### Running Jobs and Allocations
Due to Arizona sales tax restrictions {==class groups may only use the Ocelote cluster==}. To submit standard jobs on Ocelote, students will use the class group's name for the `--account` Slurm directive. For example:

```bash
#SBATCH --account=hpc101
#SBATCH --partition=standard
```
Standard hours used on Ocelote are pulled from the same pool as your research group so make sure to plan accordingly. If a student runs the command ```va```, they will see the class group as being nested under the total time allocated to your primary research group as well as any others you may have created. Students will not see the names of your other research groups if they run `va` unless they are members. 

```bash
(ocelote) [faculty_netid@wentletrap ~]$ va
Windfall: Unlimited
 
PI: parent_000 Total time: 100000:00:00
    Group: hpc101 Time used: 0:00:00 Time encumbered: 0:00:00
    Group: faculty_netid Time used: 0:00:00 Time encumbered: 0:00:00
    Total used: 0:00:00
    Total encumbered: 0:00:00
    Total remaining: 100000:00:00
```

## Delegating Group Management Rights

### Adding a Delegate
PI's can delegate management rights to trusted group members. Delegates may create research and class groups, sponsor users, remove users, and request and manage storage offerings on behalf of their faculty sponsor. To add a group member as a delegate, the PI can click the **Manage Delegates** link on the home page of the [user portal](https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/portal/).

<img src="images/manage-delegates.png" class="ood-screenshots" title="Adding a group delegate">

 In the Manage Delegates window that appears, select **Add a delegate**, enter your group member's NetID, and click :material-plus-circle-outline:.

### Instructions for Delegates

Once a group member has been added as a delegate, they can log into the user portal, then select **Switch User** from the Home tab.

<img src="images/switch_user0.png" class="ood-screenshots" title="Adding a group delegate">


In the next window, they can enter their PI's NetID under **Switch user form** --> **UA NetID**, and click :material-account-box-multiple:. They should see **Current effective user** change from their own NetID to their PI's NetID. This will allow them to perform functions on their PI's behalf. They may switch back to their own account at any time by following the same process, entering their own NetID in the form instead of their PI's.
