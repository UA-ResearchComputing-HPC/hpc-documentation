# Summary

That's it! You now should have a sense of how UArizona's HPC systems are laid out, how to log in, and how to access compute nodes and software.

To continue learning about HPC, our online documentation has a lot more information that can help get you started. For example [FAQs](../../support_and_training/faqs/), information on [HPC storage](../../storage_and_transfers/storage/hpc_storage/), and [file transfers](../../storage_and_transfers/transfers/overview/). You may also want to check out [our workshops as well as other community events](../../events/calendar/) which offer great training materials on a variety of topics. 

Other great resources include: [virtual office hours every Wednesday](../../support_and_training/office_hours/) from 2:00-4:00pm, [consultation services](../../support_and_training/consulting_services/) offered through ServiceNow, and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@universityofarizonauitsres7597) with training videos. 

## External Resources

While this documentation covers some concepts and techniques that are widely applicable, it's beyond our scope to cover everything you may need or want to know while using the HPC. We highly encourage users to supplement their learning with resources from around the web! Below are some recommended resources to get started.

Please note that information related to other HPC clusters may not necessarily apply to the UArizona HPC cluster. Each system is configured differently, and what may be supported on another system may not be supported here, or vice versa. Please refer to this documentation site for information specific to the UArizona HPC, or ask [HPC Consult](/support_and_training/consulting_services/) if you have any questions.
