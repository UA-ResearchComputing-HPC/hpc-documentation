## Overview

Just getting started with our HPC and don't know where to start? You've found the place!

If you're using an HPC system for the first time, this tutorial is designed to give you the basic tools to get you started. 

If you're experienced with HPC already but haven't used our system, this guide is intended to help familiarize you with the specifics of our HPC clusters. This should help you get up and running quickly since every HPC system is slightly different; each with its own specific commands, allocation policy, partitions, accounts, and even system layout. 

## Getting Started Checklist

Before beginning this tutorial, you'll want to ensure that you're familiarized with our system policies and have registered for an account. Take a moment to review the following pages before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial.

- [ ] **Policies**: Read up on our HPC guidelines. In particular:

    * [ ] <a href="../../policies/acknowledgements/" target="_blank">Acknowledgements</a>
    * [ ] <a href="../../policies/loss_of_university_affiliation/" target="_blank">What happens if you lose university affiliation</a>
- [ ] **Register for an account**: To log into HPC, you'll need to have registered for an account. If you have not yet done so, see <a href="../../registration_and_access/account_creation/" target="_blank">our registration documentation</a> for steps. Note that the process varies based on your university affiliation.
