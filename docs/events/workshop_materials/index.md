| Nov 13 | <details><summary>Intro to Statistics</summary>This workshop combines three purposes, the first is an introduction to Statistics and its relevance to Machine Learning, the second is an introduction to the Matlab Machine Learning Toolbox, and the third is the use of HPC to run the examples from the Toolbox. This last one demonstrates how the HPC OnDemand functionality has very similar ease of use to a workstation.</details> | Chris Reidy | [:fontawesome-brands-youtube:] | [:fontawesome-brands-google-drive:]
|Nov 22 | <details><summary>Intro to Visualization</summary>The Intro to Data Visualization presentation aims to give attendees a select tour of the visualization field, bridging theory and practice. We will explore theory used to inform the selection of chart types, and contents that support a researchers intended message. We will then practice the standard visualization development cycle of drafting, critiquing, and refactoring for a number of examples. Attendees must bring with them material to draw with, and will leave with a general thought process that may apply to any visualization task. Optional coding exercises for applying these concepts are provided.</details> | Devin Bayly | - | [:fontawesome-brands-google-drive:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TBUDi4NLj39ICPozC8m-GtiUWz1ePGZC2PK1zBfQ4yc/edit?usp=sharing) |
