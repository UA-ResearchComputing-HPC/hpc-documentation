Every semester, [we host training workshops](../workshop_materials/) on topics ranging from intro to HPC, to machine learning, to parallel computing, and beyond. In addition, there are many great opportunities for learning hosted by other organizations within the community. Whether you're interested in learning about specific programming languages, exploring data analytics techniques, or cloud computing, there's a wide array of learning opportunities available.

Check below for a list of upcoming workshops.

## HPC Calendar

We are excited to host a full semester's worth of workshops this Fall. All workshops will be held on Fridays throughout the semester from 11am to noon in the Weaver Science and Engineering Library, Rm 212. **The first two workshops have been moved to the Catalyst Studio Learning Center Room 254/252 in the Main Library!** The registration button below will allow you to register for any/all of the workshops listed below.
