# Acceptable Use

High Performance Computing (HPC) facility users are responsible for [complying with all University policies](https://policy.arizona.edu/information-technology/acceptable-use-computers-and-networks-policy).

The supercomputers represent a unique resource for the campus community. These computers have special characteristics that are not found, or are of limited availability, on other central computers, including parallel processing, large memory, and a Linux operating system. The Arizona HPC resources require close supervision by those charged with management of these resources.

## Controlled Data
Arizona HPC does not provide support for any type of controlled data. No controlled data (HIPAA, EAR, FERPA, PII, CUI, ITAR, etc.) can be analyzed or stored on any HPC storage.

For HIPAA data we maintain a separate cluster called Soteria. See [Secure Services](../../resources/secure_hpc/).

## Federal Regulations
Equipment purchased exclusively for research purposes is exempt from Arizona State Sales Tax. See [UA FSO statement of Research Equipment Tax Exemption](https://financialservices.arizona.edu/tax-services/az-sales-use/rd-exemptions). However, there are exceptions to this exemption that impact central, shared use research facilities. These exceptions include "research in social sciences or psychology"â€”see [AZ ARS 42-5061](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/42/05061.htm) subsection B.15.

> **Machinery or equipment used in research and development**. For the purposes of this paragraph, "research and development" means **basic and applied research in the sciences and engineering**, and designing, developing or testing prototypes, processes or new products, including research and development of computer software that is embedded in or an integral part of the prototype or new product or that is required for machinery or equipment otherwise exempt under this section to function effectively. **Research and development do not include** manufacturing quality control, routine consumer product testing, market research, sales promotion, sales service, **research in social sciences or psychology**, computer software research that is not included in the definition of research and development, or other nontechnological activities or technical services. (emphasis added)

In order to provide research computing resources to researchers from these exception areas, some of the research computing resources have been purchased with Arizona taxes included. The result is that there are resources available to all campus researchers, with the caveat that researchers in the social sciences, psychology and instructional projects areas are restricted to using resources that are purchased with taxes paid.

Please [contact our HPC consultants](../../support_and_training/consulting_services/) to learn about the resources that are available for social sciences, psychology and instructional purposes.

## Access for Research and Limited Access for Instruction

As described in the **'Sales Tax Exemption'** section above, most of the HPC systems are limited to research applications as defined in [Section B-14 of ARS Statute 42-5061](http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/42/05061.htm) by the Arizona Legislature. All users are expected to use these resources accordingly and to use other computing systems for non-research purposes.
