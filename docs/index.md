## Highlighted Research

=== "Ten Millionth Job"

    <img class="highlighted-research" title="'kiss-and-capture' astronomy simulation" src="./assets/images/home/tenmillion.png" width="30%" style="margin: 20px;">

    Puma has been a tremendous resource for our research community. Just recently it processed the 10 millionth job since we provisioned it in 2020. Just to get a perspective on that, if you took one step for each job you could walk to Niagara Falls. And back.

    David Castellano, a member of Dr. Ryan Gutenkunst's team, was the researcher who achieved this milestone. They study the evolutionary processes that generated the complex networks that comprise life. Dr. Gutenkunst told us that David’s been maximizing his chances to hit this milestone with all the jobs he’s been running.

    David says about his work: “Understanding the relationship between DNA mutation rates and fitness effects is central to evolutionary biology. My work is investigating this relationship in three species: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The inference of fitness effects from population genomics data requires intensive computation which could not be possible without a High Performance Computing service.”

    The software used in their research is called  ‘dadi’: Diffusion Approximations for Demographic Inference. This work on three species with 96 mutation types and 1000 bootstrap replicates equates to 288,000 compute jobs.


=== "Planetary History"
    
    **Reconstructing the History of the Solar System Using HPC**

    <img class="highlighted-research" title="'kiss-and-capture' astronomy simulation" src="./assets/images/home/highlighted_research.png" width="50%" style="margin: 20px;">

    Erik Asphaug’s Planetary Formation Lab in the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory uses smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to explore how collisions between bodies in the Solar System shape its evolution through time. These three-dimensional simulations, which approximate planetary bodies as collections of particles, incorporate realistic geologic properties to track their structural and thermal changes during and after giant impacts. 
    From Eric: “The access to increased time allocations as well as large volumes of temporary storage on xdisk provided by the HPC has revolutionized our ability to run our most complex simulations at high resolution, with enough space and time to explore the full parameter space necessary to make key discoveries that inform our understanding of Solar System evolution.”

    One of their major projects has occupied a large fraction of their HPC hours and storage: the capture of Pluto’s moon, Charon, from a giant impact early in the Solar System’s history.
    High resolution is also critical to track detailed interactions between Pluto and Charon, including any material transferred between them. Without the HPC and the allocation of computation time and storage space, they would not have been able to run the hundreds of models necessary to successfully reproduce systems that look similar to Pluto and Charon today. The models have revealed new insights about how bodies like Pluto capture satellites: the dwarf planet and its proto-satellite collide, briefly merge, and then re-separate as Charon slow begins to move outward. They call this new process, which significantly redefines our understanding of giant collisions, “kiss and capture.” An example kiss-and-capture is shown in the image above. The simulation shown covers 60 hours of model time, which takes ~1.5 months on the HPC. The ability to run such long simulations in parallel was crucial to completing this work.

=== "Cloud Research"
    <img src="./assets/images/home/sullivan_lab.png" title="cloud research" align="right" width="300px">
    Sylvia Sullivan is an Assistant Professor in Chemical and Environmental Engineering who performs atmospherically related research and has a joint appointment to the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences. Her academic background is in chemical engineering, but she has picked up atmospheric science and computing skills along the way to model and understand cloud and storm systems. “I really liked environmental work because I felt it was very impactful,” she says.  Her research includes investigating cloud ice formation. From a chemical engineering perspective, you can think about clouds as a control volume, flows in and out and phase changes occurring inside. Along with this more technical view, Sylvia says she “fell in love with clouds because they are very beautiful and poetic”. This blend of fields brought her to the University of Arizona as it is one of the only Universities where Chemical and Environmental Engineering are in the same department. And besides, “Tucson is a wonderful location”.

    <img src="./assets/images/home/cloud_research.png" title="cloud research" align="left" width="300px">
    She is building a research group to study the impact of ice clouds, particularly their energetic and precipitation effects. Sylvia’s group runs very high-resolution simulations called storm resolving simulations, where the meshes are fine enough to represent individual storms. In global climate models, the mesh has a resolution on the order of 100 km, in which several storm cells can form simultaneously. These storm-resolving computations are very expensive and produce terabytes of data, which then need to be post-processed and visualized. Currently, Sylvia and her group are very focused on working with other visualization experts on campus to illustrate the structures and evolution of clouds and storm systems.

=== "Hypersonic Flow"
    
    **Faster Speeds Need Faster Computation**

    <img src="./assets/images/home/HypersonicTravel.jpg" title="flow structures visualization" align="right" width="300px">

    Professors Christoph Hader, Hermann Fasel, and their team are exploring the use of our GPUs to optimize Navier-Stokes codes for simulating the flow field around hypersonic vehicles traveling at size times the speed of sound (Mach 6) or more.

    In the image to the right, instantaneous flow structures obtained from a DNS for a flared cone at Mach 6 are visualized using the Q-isocontours colored with instantaneous temperature disturbance values. The small scales towards the end of the computational domain indicate the regions where the boundary layer is turbulent. 

## Available Resources

??? info "Our Clusters (click to expand)"

    === "Puma"
        <img class="img-right" src="assets/images/home/puma.png" title="Puma image" alt="puma" width="200" hspace=50 vspace=20>
        Implemented in the middle of 2020, Puma is the biggest cat yet. Similar to Ocelote, it has standard CPU nodes (with 94 cores and 512 GB of memory per node), GPU nodes (with Nvidia V100) and two high-memory nodes (3 TB). Local scratch storage increased to ~1.4 TB. Puma runs on CentOS 7.

        As is the case for our other supercomputers, we use the RFP process to get the best value for our financial resources, that meet our technical requirements. This time Penguin Computing one with AMD processors. This is tremendously valuable as each node comes with:

        - Two AMD Zen2 48 core processors
        - 512GB RAM
        - 25Gb path to storage
        - 25Gb path to other nodes for MPI
        - 2TB internal NVME disk (largely available as /tmp)
        - Qumulo all flash storage array for shared filesystems
        - Two large memory nodes with 3TB memory and the same processors and memory as the other nodes
        - Six nodes with four Nvidia V100S GPU's each

    === "Ocelote"
        <img class="img-right" src="assets/images/home/ocelote.png" title="Ocelote image" alt="ocelote" width="250" hspace=50 vspace=20>
        Ocelote arrived in 2016. Lenovo's Nextscale M5 technology was the winner of the RFP mainly on price, performance and meeting our specific requirements. Ocelote has one large memory node with 2TB of memory and 46 nodes with Nvidia P100 GPUs for GPU-accelerated workflows. This cluster is actually the next generation of the IBM cluster we call El Gato. Lenovo purchased IBM's Intel server line in 2015.

        In 2021, Ocelote's operating system was upgraded from CentOS6 to CentOS7 and was configured to use SLURM, like Puma. It will continue until it is either too expensive to maintain or it is replaced by something else.
            - Intel Haswell V3 28 core processors
            - 192GB RAM per node
            - FDR infiniband for fast MPI interconnect
            - Qumulo all flash storage array (all HPC storage is integrated into one array)
            - One large memory node with 2TB RAM, Intel Ivy Bridge V2 48 cores
            - 46 nodes with Nvidia P100 GPU's

    === "El Gato"
        <img class="img-right" src="assets/images/home/jones.png" title="ElGato image" alt="elgato" width="100" hspace=75>
        Implemented at the start of 2014, El Gato has been reprovisioned with CentOS 7 and new compilers and libraries. From July 2021 it has been using Slurm for job submission. El Gato is our smallest cluster with 130 standard nodes each with 16 CPUs. Purchased by an NSF MRI grant by researchers in Astronomy and SISTA.
