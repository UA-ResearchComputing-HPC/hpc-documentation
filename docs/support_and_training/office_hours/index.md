    Due to a change in Gather Town policy, as of September 15th, 2025 we have transitioned to using WorkAdventure for our office hours services. The new link is provided below.

We host virtual, drop-in office hours every Wednesday from 2:00-4:00pm. Drop by to visit with our consultants to ask any questions you have about using HPC resources. It might be a bunch of getting started questions, or you might want to share your screen to walk us through a particular problem you're hung up on. We have private spaces for one-on-one consults. You can [join us in WorkAdventure at this link](https://workadventure.tra220030.projects.jetstream-cloud.org/_/global/saramwillis.github.io/office-hours/office.tmj).
